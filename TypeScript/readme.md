# Steps of refactoring

- install Jest for better testing
- write initial unit tests
- clean up by moving some conditions into seperate functions for reuse
- because of so many "if" statements, I've decided to create a rule engine, to make app scalable by making it easier to add new rules
- add rules and refactor tests.
